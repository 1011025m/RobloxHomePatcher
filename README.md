# RobloxHomePatcher
Good ol' Roblox making unnecessary changes rather than upgrading their player client to 64-bit... C'mon you know better!

This is just a simple python script that patches the `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe` so that it wouldn't launch the in-app homepage. 

The script uses the same implementation from @lolmanurfunny, except I am not comfortable with distributing modified binaries on GitHub. It's very crappy for sure, but I'll need some more time to investigate.

If you don't have python, you can grab an executable from Releases. Executable is built with PyInstaller.
