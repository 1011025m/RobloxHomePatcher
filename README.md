# RobloxHomePatcher
Good ol' Roblox making unnecessary changes rather than upgrading their player client to 64-bit... C'mon you know better!

This is just a simple python script that patches the `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe` so that it wouldn't launch the in-app homepage.

If you don't have python, you can grab an executable from Releases. Executable is built with PyInstaller.
